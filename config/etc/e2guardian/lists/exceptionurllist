#URLs in exception list
#Don't bother with the www. or
#the http://
#
#These are parts of sites that filtering should
#be switched off for.
#
#These should not be domains, i.e. entire sites,
#they should be a domain with a path.
#
#For example 'foo.bar' is no good, you need
#to just have 'foo.bar/porn/'.
#
#Another example:
#generallybadsite.tld/partthatsok/
