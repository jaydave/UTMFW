<span class="bold">DESCRIPTION</span>
     SSLproxy is a proxy for SSL/TLS encrypted network connections. It is
     intended to be used for decrypting and diverting network traffic to other
     programs, such as UTM services, for deep SSL inspection. But it can
     handle unencrypted network traffic as well.

     The UTMFW project uses SSLproxy to decyrpt and feed network traffic into
     its UTM services: Web Filter, POP3 Proxy, SMTP Proxy, and Inline IPS; and
     also indirectly into Virus Scanner and Spam Filter through those UTM
     software.  Given that most of the Internet traffic is encrypted now,
     without SSLproxy it wouldn't be possible to deeply inspect most of the
     network traffic passing through UTMFW.

<span class="bold">Mode</span> <span class="bold">of</span> <span class="bold">operation</span>
     SSLproxy is designed to transparently terminate connections that are
     redirected to it using a network address translation engine. SSLproxy
     then terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the
     original destination address. Packets received on the client side are
     decrypted and sent to the program listening on a port given in the proxy
     specification. SSLproxy inserts in the first packet the address and port
     it is expecting to receive the packets back from the program. Upon
     receiving the packets back, SSLproxy re-encrypts and sends them to their
     original destination. The return traffic follows the same path back to
     the client in reverse order.

     This is similar in principle to divert sockets, divert(4), where the
     packet filter diverts the packets to a program listening on a divert
     socket, and after processing the packets the program reinjects them into
     the kernel. If there is no program listening on that divert socket or the
     program does not reinject the packets into the kernel, the connection is
     effectively blocked. In the case of SSLproxy, SSLproxy acts as both the
     packet filter and the kernel, and the communication occurs over
     networking sockets.

     SSLproxy supports split mode of operation similar to SSLsplit as well. In
     split mode, packets are not diverted to listening programs, effectively
     making SSLproxy behave similar to SSLsplit, but not exactly like it,
     because SSLproxy has certain features non-existent in SSLsplit, such as
     user authentication, protocol validation, and filtering rules. Also, note
     that the implementation of the proxy core in SSLproxy is different from
     the one in SSLsplit; for example, the proxy core in SSLproxy runs
     lockless, whereas SSLsplit implementation uses a thread manager level
     lock (which does not necessarily make sslproxy run faster than sslsplit).
     In SSLproxy, split mode can be defined globally, per-proxyspec, or per-
     connection using filtering rules.

     SSLproxy does not automagically redirect any network traffic.  To
     actually implement a proxy, you also need to redirect the traffic to the
     system running <span class="bold">sslproxy</span>.  Your options include running <span class="bold">sslproxy</span> on a
     legitimate router, ARP spoofing, ND spoofing, DNS poisoning, deploying a
     rogue access point (e.g. using hostap mode), physical recabling,
     malicious VLAN reconfiguration or route injection, /etc/hosts
     modification and so on.
<a name="proxyspec"></a>
     <span class="bold">Proxy</span> <span class="bold">specifications</span>
     SSLproxy supports three different types of proxy specifications, or
     proxyspecs for short, which can be in divert or split style.

      - Command line proxyspecs passed on the command line
      - One line proxyspecs in configuration files
      - Structured proxyspecs in configuration files

     The syntax of command line proxyspecs is as follows:

     (tcp|ssl|http|https|pop3|pop3s|smtp|smtps|autossl)
       listenaddr listenport
       [up:divertport [ua:divertaddr ra:returnaddr]]
       [(targetaddr targetport|sni sniport|natengine)]

     The syntax of one line proxyspecs is the same as the syntax of command
     line proxyspecs, except for the leading ProxySpec keyword:

     ProxySpec (tcp|ssl|http|https|pop3|pop3s|smtp|smtps|autossl)
       listenaddr listenport
       [up:divertport [ua:divertaddr ra:returnaddr]]
       [(targetaddr targetport|sni sniport|natengine)]

     The syntax of structured proxyspecs is as follows, and they can configure
     connection options too:

     ProxySpec {
         Proto (tcp|ssl|http|https|pop3|pop3s|smtp|smtps|autossl)
         Addr listenaddr       # inline
         Port listenport       # comments
         DivertPort divertport # allowed
         DivertAddr divertaddr
         ReturnAddr returnaddr
         TargetAddr targetaddr
         TargetPort targetport
         SNIPort sniport
         NatEngine natengine

         DivertUsers userlist
         PassUsers userlist
         PassSite rules

         Define $macro valuelist

         (Divert|Split|Pass|Block|Match) one line filtering rules
         FilterRule {...} structured filtering rules
     }

     For example, given the following command line proxyspec:

     https 127.0.0.1 8443 up:8080

      - SSLproxy listens for HTTPS connections on 127.0.0.1:8443.
      - Upon receiving a connection from the Client, it decrypts and diverts
     the packets to a Program listening on 127.0.0.1:8080. The default divert
     address is 127.0.0.1, which can be configured by the ua option.
      - After processing the packets, the Program gives them back to SSLproxy
     listening on a dynamically assigned address, which the Program obtains
     from the SSLproxy line in the first packet in the connection.
      - Then SSLproxy re-encrypts and sends the packets to the Server.

     The response from the Server follows the same path back to the Client in
     reverse order.

     Split style proxyspecs configure for split mode of operation similar to
     SSLsplit. See the SSLsplit documentation for the details of split style
     proxyspecs.

     <span class="bold">SSLproxy</span> <span class="bold">line</span>
     Given the proxyspec example above, a sample line SSLproxy inserts into
     the first packet in the connection may be the following:

     SSLproxy: [127.0.0.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s

      - The first IP:port pair is a dynamically assigned address that SSLproxy
     expects the program send the packets back to it.
      - The second and third IP:port pairs are the actual source and
     destination addresses of the connection, respectively. Since the program
     receives the packets from SSLproxy, it cannot determine the source and
     destination addresses of the packets by itself, for example by asking the
     NAT engine, hence must rely on the information in the SSLproxy line.
      - The last letter is either s or p, for SSL/TLS encrypted or plain
     traffic, respectively. This information is also important for the
     program, because it cannot reliably determine if the actual network
     traffic it is processing was encrypted or not before being diverted to
     it.

     <span class="bold">Listening</span> <span class="bold">programs</span>
     The program that packets are diverted to should support this mode of
     operation.  Specifically, it should be able to recognize the SSLproxy
     address in the first packet, and give the first and subsequent packets
     back to SSLproxy listening on that address, instead of sending them to
     their original destination as it normally would.

     You can use any software as a listening program as long as it supports
     this mode of operation. So existing or new software developed in any
     programming language can be modified to be used with SSLproxy to inspect
     and/or modify any or all parts of the packets diverted to it.

     Given the proxyspec example above, a program should be listening on port
     8080.

     You can offload the system SSLproxy is running on by diverting packets to
     remote listening programs too. For example, given the following proxy
     specification:

     https 127.0.0.1 8443 up:8080 ua:192.168.0.1 ra:192.168.1.1

      - The ua option instructs SSLproxy to divert packets to
     192.168.0.1:8080, instead of 127.0.0.1:8080 as in the previous proxyspec
     example.
      - The ra option instructs SSLproxy to listen for returned packets from
     the program on 192.168.1.1, instead of 127.0.0.1 as in the previous
     SSLproxy line.

     Accordingly, the SSLproxy line now becomes (notice the first IP address):

     SSLproxy:
     [192.168.1.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s

     And a listening program should be running at address 192.168.0.1 on port
     8080.

     So, the listening program can be running on a machine anywhere in the
     world.  Since the packets between SSLproxy and the listening program are
     always unencrypted, you should be careful while using such a setup.
<a name="proto"></a>
<span class="bold">Protocols</span>
     <span class="bold">Supported</span> <span class="bold">protocols</span>
     SSLproxy supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, POP3S, SMTP,
     and SMTPS connections over both IPv4 and IPv6. It also has the ability to
     dynamically upgrade plain TCP to SSL in order to generically support SMTP
     STARTTLS and similar upgrade mechanisms. Depending on the version of
     OpenSSL, SSLproxy supports SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS
     1.3, and optionally SSL 2.0 as well. SSLproxy supports Server Name
     Indication (SNI), but not Encrypted SNI in TLS 1.3. It is able to work
     with RSA, DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and ECDHE cipher suites.

     The following features of SSLproxy are IPv4 only:

      - Divert addresses for listening programs in proxyspecs
      - SSLproxy return addresses dynamically assigned to connections
      - IP addresses in the ua and ra options
      - IP and ethernet addresses of clients in user authentication
      - Target IP and ethernet addresses in mirror logging

     <span class="bold">OCSP,</span> <span class="bold">HPKP,</span> <span class="bold">HSTS,</span> <span class="bold">Upgrade</span> <span class="bold">et</span> <span class="bold">al.</span>
     SSLproxy implements a number of defences against mechanisms which would
     normally prevent MitM attacks or make them more difficult. SSLproxy can
     deny OCSP requests in a generic way. For HTTP and HTTPS connections,
     SSLproxy mangles headers to prevent server-instructed public key pinning
     (HPKP), avoid strict transport security restrictions (HSTS), avoid
     Certificate Transparency enforcement (Expect-CT) and prevent switching to
     QUIC/SPDY, HTTP/2 or WebSockets (Upgrade, Alternate Protocols). HTTP
     compression, encodings and keep-alive are disabled to make the logs more
     readable.

     Another reason to disable persistent connections is to reduce file
     descriptor usage. Accordingly, connections are closed if they remain idle
     for a certain period of time. The default timeout is 120 seconds, which
     can be configured by the ConnIdleTimeout option.

     <span class="bold">Protocol</span> <span class="bold">validation</span>
     Protocol validation makes sure the traffic handled by a proxyspec is
     using the protocol specified in that proxyspec. If a connection cannot
     pass protocol validation, it is terminated. To enable protocol
     validation, the ValidateProto option can be defined globally, per-
     proxyspec, or per-connection using filtering rules. This feature
     currently supports HTTP, POP3, and SMTP protocols.

     SSLproxy uses only client requests for protocol validation. However, it
     also validates SMTP responses until it starts processing the packets from
     the client. If there is no excessive fragmentation, the first couple of
     packets in the connection should be enough for validating protocols.

<span class="bold">Certificates</span>
     <span class="bold">Certificate</span> <span class="bold">forging</span>
     For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLproxy generates and signs forged X509v3
     certificates on-the-fly, mimicking the original server certificate's
     subject DN, subjectAltName extension and other characteristics. SSLproxy
     has the ability to use existing certificates of which the private key is
     available, instead of generating forged ones. SSLproxy supports NULL-
     prefix CN certificates but otherwise does not implement exploits against
     specific certificate verification vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.

     <span class="bold">Certificate</span> <span class="bold">verification</span>
     SSLproxy verifies upstream certificates by default. If the verification
     fails, the connection is terminated immediately. This is in contrast to
     SSLsplit, because in order to maximize the chances that a connection can
     be successfully split, SSLsplit accepts all certificates by default,
     including self-signed ones. See the risks of SSL inspection for the
     reasons for this difference. You can enable or disable this feature by
     the VerifyPeer option, which can be defined globally, per-proxyspec, or
     per-connection using filtering rules.

     <span class="bold">Client</span> <span class="bold">certificates</span>
     SSLproxy uses the certificate and key from the pemfiles configured by the
     ClientCert and ClientKey options when the destination requests client
     certificates. These options can be defined globally, per-proxyspec, or
     per-connection using filtering rules.

     Alternatively, you can use Pass filtering rules to pass through certain
     destinations requesting client certificates.

<span class="bold">User</span> <span class="bold">authentication</span>
     If the UserAuth option is enabled, SSLproxy requires network users to log
     in to the system to establish connections to the external network.

     SSLproxy determines the user owner of a connection using a users table in
     an SQLite3 database configured by the UserDBPath option. The users table
     should be created using the following SQL statement:

     CREATE TABLE USERS(
        IP             CHAR(45)     PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
        USER           CHAR(31)     NOT NULL,
        ETHER          CHAR(17)     NOT NULL,
        ATIME          INT          NOT NULL,
        DESC           CHAR(50) );

     SSLproxy does not create this users table or the database file by itself,
     nor does it log users in or out. So the database file with the users
     table should already exist at the location pointed to by the UserDBPath
     option. An external program should log users in and out on the users
     table. The external program should fill out all the fields in user
     records, except perhaps for the DESC field, which can be left blank.

     When SSLproxy accepts a connection,

      - It searches the client IP address of the connection in the users
     table. If the client IP address is not in the users table, the connection
     is redirected to a login page configured by the UserAuthURL option.
      - If SSLproxy finds a user record for the client IP address in the users
     table, it obtains the ethernet address of the client IP address from the
     arp cache of the system, and compares it with the value in the user
     record for that IP address. If the client IP address is not in the arp
     cache, or the ethernet addresses do not match, the connection is
     redirected to the login page.
      - If the ethernet addresses match, SSLproxy compares the atime value in
     the user record with the current system time. If the difference is
     greater than the value configured by the UserTimeout option, the
     connection is redirected to the login page.

     If the connection passes all these checks, SSLproxy proceeds with
     establishing the connection.

     The atime of the IP address in the users table is updated with the system
     time while the connection is being terminated. Since this atime update is
     executed using a privsep command, it is expensive. So, to reduce the
     frequency of such updates, it is deferred until after the user idle time
     is more than half of the timeout period.

     If a description text is provided in the DESC field, it can be used with
     filtering rules to treat the user logged in from different locations,
     i.e.  from different client IP addresses, differently.

     If the UserAuth option is enabled, the user owner of the connection is
     appended at the end of the SSLproxy line, so that the listening program
     can parse and use this information in its logic and/or logging:

     SSLproxy:
     [127.0.0.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s,soner

     The user authentication feature is currently available on OpenBSD and
     Linux only.
<a name="Filter"></a>
<span class="bold">Filtering</span> <span class="bold">rules</span>
     SSLproxy can divert, split, pass, block, or match connections based on
     filtering rules. Filtering rules can be defined globally and/or per-
     proxyspec.

      - Divert action diverts packets to the listening program, allowing SSL
     inspection by the listening program and content logging of packets
      - Split action splits the connection but does not divert packets to the
     listening program, effectively disabling SSL inspection by the listening
     program, but allowing content logging of packets
      - Pass action passes the connection through by engaging passthrough
     mode, effectively disabling SSL inspection and content logging of packets
      - Block action terminates the connection
      - Match action specifies log actions and/or connection options for the
     connection without changing its filter action

     SSLproxy supports one line and structured filtering rules.

     The syntax of one line filtering rules is as follows:

     (Divert|Split|Pass|Block|Match)
      ([from (
          user (username[*]|$macro|*) [desc (desc[*]|$macro|*)]|
          desc (desc[*]|$macro|*)|
          ip (clientip[*]|$macro|*)|
          *)]
       [to (
          (sni (servername[*]|$macro|*)|
           cn (commonname[*]|$macro|*)|
           host (host[*]|$macro|*)|
           uri (uri[*]|$macro|*)|
           ip (serverip[*]|$macro|*)) [port (serverport[*]|$macro|*)]|
          port (serverport[*]|$macro|*)|
          *)]
       [log ([[!]connect] [[!]master] [[!]cert]
             [[!]content] [[!]pcap] [[!]mirror] [$macro]|[!]*)]
       |*) [# comment]

     The syntax of structured filtering rules is as follows, and they can
     configure connection options too:

     FilterRule {
         Action (Divert|Split|Pass|Block|Match)

         # From

     The specification of which connections a filtering rule will be applied
     to is achieved by the from and to parts of the filtering rule and by the
     proxyspec that the rule is defined for.
<a name="from"></a><a name="to"></a>
      - The from part of a rule defines source filter based on client IP
     address, user and/or description, or * for all.
      - The to part defines destination filter based on server IP and/or port,
     SNI or Common Names of SSL connections, Host or URI fields in HTTP
     Request headers, or * for all.
         + Dst Host type of rules use the ip site field
         + SSL type of rules use the sni or cn site field
         + HTTP type of rules use the host or uri site field
         + All rule types can use the port field
      - The proxyspec handling the connection defines the protocol filter for
     the connection.
<a name="log"></a>
     If and how a connection should be logged is specified using the log or
     Log part of one line or structured filtering rules, respectively:

      - connect enables logging connection information to connect log file
      - master enables logging of master keys
      - cert enables logging of generated certificates
      - content enables logging packet contents to content log file
      - pcap enables writing packets to pcap file
      - mirror enables mirroring packets to mirror interface or target

     You can add a negation prefix ! to a log action to disable that logging.

     Structured filtering rules can also specify connection options to be
     selectively applied to matching connections, not just globally or per-
     proxyspec. One line filtering rules cannot specify connection options.

     For example, if the following rules are defined in a structured HTTPS
     proxyspec,

      Split from user soner desc notebook to sni example.com log content
      Pass from user soner desc android to cn .fbcdn.net*

     The first filtering rule above splits but does not divert HTTPS
     connections from the user soner who has logged in with the description
     notebook to SSL sites with the SNI of example.com. Also, the rule
     specifies that the packet contents of the matching connection be written
     to content log file configured globally.

     The second rule passes through HTTPS connections from the user soner who
     has logged in with the description android to SSL sites with the Common
     Names containing the substring .fbcdn.net anywhere in it (notice the
     asterisk at the end). Since connection contents cannot be written to log
     files in passthrough mode, the rule does not specify any content log
     action.

     The default filter action is Divert. So, if those are the only filtering
     rules in that proxyspec, the other connections are diverted to the
     listening program specified in that proxyspec, without writing any logs.

     If you want to enable, say, connect logging for the other connections
     handled by that proxyspec, without changing their default Divert filter
     action, you can add a third filtering rule to that proxyspec:

      Match * log connect

     Note that the second example above is a filtering rule you can use to
     resolve one of the certificate issues preventing the Facebook application
     on Android smartphones to connect to the Internet from behind sslproxy.

     Filtering rules are applied based on certain precedence orders:

      - More specific rules have higher precedence. Log actions increase rule
     precedence too.
      - The precedence of filter types is as HTTP &gt; SSL &gt; Dst Host. Because,
     the application order of filter types is as Dst Host &gt; SSL &gt; HTTP, and a
     filter type can override the actions of a preceding filter type.
      - The precedence of filter actions is as Divert &gt; Split &gt; Pass &gt; Block.
     This is only for the same type of filtering rules.
      - The precedence of site fields is as sni &gt; cn for SSL filter and host &gt;
     uri for HTTP filter.

     For example, the pass action of a Dst Host filter rule is taken before
     the split action of an SSL filter rule with the same from definition, due
     to the precedence order of filter types. Or, the pass action of a rule
     with sni site field is taken before the split action of the same rule
     with cn site field, due to the precedence order of site fields.

     Pass and Block filter actions are deferred until the last moment they can
     be applied to a connection, so that Divert and Split filter actions can
     override them.

     In terms of possible filter actions,

      - Dst Host filtering rules can take all of the filter and log actions.
      - SSL filtering rules can take all of the filter and log actions.
      - HTTP filtering rules can take match and block filter actions, can keep
     enabled divert and split modes, but cannot take pass action. Also, HTTP
     filtering rules can only disable logging.

     Log actions do not configure any loggers. Global loggers for respective
     log actions should have been configured for those log actions to have any
     effect.

     If no filtering rules are defined for a proxyspec, all log actions for
     that proxyspec are enabled. Otherwise, all log actions are disabled, and
     filtering rules should enable them specifically.

     To increase rule reuse, one or more of SNI, CN, Host, URI, and DstIp site
     fields can be specified in the same structured filtering rule.

     Connection options specified in a structured filtering rule can have any
     effect only if the rule matches the connection before global or proxyspec
     connection options are applied. Otherwise, the global or proxyspec
     connection options already applied to a connection cannot be overriden by
     the connection options specified in the matching structured filtering
     rule. For example, SSL options of a connection cannot be changed after
     the SSL connection is established. So, normally SSL type of rules cannot
     modify SSL options of a connection, but you can use the ReconnectSSL
     option to reconnect the server side of an SSL connection to enforce the
     SSL options in the SSL type of filtering rules. In other words, the
     ReconnectSSL option allows for using the SNI and CN fields in stuctured
     filtering rules to match SSL connections and change their SSL
     configuration.

     Macro expansion is supported. The Define option can be used for defining
     macros to be used in filtering rules. Macro names must start with a $
     sign.  The macro name must be followed by words separated by spaces.

     You can append an asterisk * to the fields in filtering rules for
     substring matching. Otherwise, the filter searches for an exact match
     with the field in the rule. The filter uses B-trees for exact string
     matching and Aho-Corasick machines for substring matching.

     The ordering of filtering rules is important. The ordering of from, to,
     and log parts of one line filtering rules is not important. The ordering
     of log actions is not important.

     If the UserAuth option is disabled, only client IP addresses can be used
     in the from part of filtering rules.

     <span class="bold">Excluding</span> <span class="bold">sites</span> <span class="bold">from</span> <span class="bold">SSL</span> <span class="bold">inspection</span>
     PassSite option is a special form of Pass filtering rule. PassSite rules
     can be written as Pass filtering rules. The PassSite option will be
     deprecated in favor of filtering rules in the future.

     PassSite option allows certain SSL sites to be excluded from SSL
     inspection.  If a PassSite rule matches the SNI or Common Names in the
     SSL certificate of a connection, the connection is passed through the
     proxy without being diverted to the listening program. SSLproxy engages
     the Passthrough mode for that purpose. For example, sites requiring
     client authentication can be added as PassSite rules.

     Per-site filters can be defined using client IP addresses, users, and
     description. If the UserAuth option is disabled, only client IP addresses
     can be used in PassSite filters. Multiple sites can be defined, one on
     each line.  PassSite rules can search for exact or substring matches, but
     do not support macro expansion.

     <span class="bold">User</span> <span class="bold">control</span> <span class="bold">lists</span>
     User control lists can be implemented using filtering rules. The
     DivertUsers and PassUsers options will be deprecated in favor of
     filtering rules in the future.

     DivertUsers and PassUsers options can be used to divert, pass through, or
     block users.

      - If neither DivertUsers nor PassUsers is defined, all users are
     diverted to listening programs.
      - Connections from users in DivertUsers, if defined, are diverted to
     listening programs.
      - Connections from users in PassUsers, if defined, are simply passed
     through to their original destinations. SSLproxy engages the Passthrough
     mode for that purpose.
      - If both DivertUsers and PassUsers are defined, users not listed in
     either of the lists are blocked. SSLproxy simply terminates their
     connections.
      - If *no* DivertUsers list is defined, only users *not* listed in
     PassUsers are diverted to listening programs.

     These user control lists can be defined globally or per-proxyspec. User
     control lists do not support macro expansion.

<span class="bold">Logging</span>
     Logging options include connect and content log files as well as PCAP
     files and mirroring decrypted traffic to a network interface.
     Additionally, certificates, master secrets and local process information
     can be logged.  Filtering rules can selectively modify connection
     logging.

<span class="bold">OPTIONS</span>
     <span class="bold">-a</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use client certificate from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> when destination server
            requests a client certificate.

     <span class="bold">-A</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use private key, certificate and certificate chain from PEM file
            <span class="underline">pemfile</span> as leaf certificate instead of generating a leaf
            certificate on the fly.  The PEM file must contain a single
            private key, a single certificate and optionally intermediate and
            root CA certificates to use as certificate chain.  When using <span class="bold">-t</span>,
            SSLproxy will first attempt to use a matching certificate loaded
            from <span class="underline">certdir</span>.  If <span class="bold">-t</span> is also used and a connection matches any
            certificate in the directory specified with the <span class="bold">-t</span> option, that
            matching certificate is used instead, taking precedence over the
            certificate specified with <span class="bold">-A</span>.

     <span class="bold">-b</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use client private key from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> when destination server
            requests a client certificate.

     <span class="bold">-B</span> <span class="underline">proto</span>
            Enable the SSL/TLS protocol version <span class="underline">proto</span> on both client and
            server side by enabling the respective protocols in OpenSSL.  To
            enable multiple protocol versions, <span class="bold">-B</span> can be given multiple times.
            This option can be used to enable any proto disabled before.
            Otherwise, all available protocols are enabled by default. See the
            <span class="bold">-R</span> option for further details.

     <span class="bold">-c</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use CA certificate from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> to sign certificates forged on-
            the-fly.  If <span class="underline">pemfile</span> also contains the matching CA private key, it
            is also loaded, otherwise it must be provided with <span class="bold">-k</span>.  If <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            also contains Diffie-Hellman group parameters, they are also
            loaded, otherwise they can be provided with <span class="bold">-g</span>.  If <span class="bold">-t</span> is also
            given, SSLproxy will only forge a certificate if there is no
            matching certificate in the provided certificate directory.

     <span class="bold">-C</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use CA certificates from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> as extra certificates in the
            certificate chain.  This is needed if the CA given with <span class="bold">-k</span> and <span class="bold">-c</span>
            is a sub-CA, in which case any intermediate CA certificates and
            the root CA certificate must be included in the certificate chain.

     <span class="bold">-d</span>     Detach from TTY and run as a daemon, logging error messages to
            syslog instead of standard error.

     <span class="bold">-D</span> <span class="underline">level</span>
            Run in debug mode, log lots of debugging information to standard
            error.  This also forces foreground mode and cannot be used with
            <span class="bold">-d</span>. Debug <span class="underline">level</span> can be a number from 1 to 4, a higher number
            meaning more verbosity.

     <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="underline">engine</span>
            Use <span class="underline">engine</span> as the default NAT engine for <span class="underline">proxyspecs</span> without
            explicit NAT engine, static destination address or SNI mode.
            <span class="underline">engine</span> can be any of the NAT engines supported by the system, as
            returned by <span class="bold">-E</span>.

     <span class="bold">-E</span>     List all supported NAT engines available on the system and exit.
            See NAT ENGINES for a list of NAT engines currently supported by
            SSLproxy.

     <span class="bold">-f</span> <span class="underline">conffile</span>
            Read configuration from <span class="underline">conffile</span>. Configuration files can use the
            Include option for loading configuration from an include file too.
            Note that the ordering of options, rules, and proxyspecs in
            configuration files (and on the command line) is important. For
            example, rules and proxyspecs can only make use of the options
            defined earlier.

     <span class="bold">-F</span> <span class="underline">logspec</span>
            Log connection content to separate log files with the given path
            specification (see LOG SPECIFICATIONS below).  For each
            connection, a log file will be written, which will contain both
            directions of data as transmitted.  Information about the
            connection will be contained in the filename only.  Only one of
            <span class="bold">-F</span>, <span class="bold">-L</span> and <span class="bold">-S</span> may be used (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-g</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use Diffie-Hellman group parameters from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> for Ephemereal
            Diffie-Hellman (EDH/DHE) cipher suites.  If <span class="bold">-g</span> is not given,
            SSLproxy first tries to load DH parameters from the PEM files
            given by <span class="bold">-K</span>, <span class="bold">-k</span> or <span class="bold">-c</span>.  If no DH parameters are found in the key
            files, built-in group parameters are automatically used.  The <span class="bold">-g</span>
            option is only available if SSLproxy was built against a version
            of OpenSSL which supports Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.

     <span class="bold">-G</span> <span class="underline">curve</span>
            Use the named <span class="underline">curve</span> for Ephemereal Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
            (ECDHE) cipher suites.  If <span class="bold">-G</span> is not given, a default curve
            (<span class="bold">prime256v1</span>) is used automatically.  The <span class="bold">-G</span> option is only
            available if SSLproxy was built against a version of OpenSSL which
            supports Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.

     <span class="bold">-h</span>     Display help on usage and exit.

     <span class="bold">-i</span>     For each connection, find the local process owning the connection.
            This makes process information such as pid, owner:group and
            executable path for connections originating on the same system as
            SSLproxy available to the connect log and enables the respective
            <span class="bold">-F</span> path specification directives.  <span class="bold">-i</span> is available on Mac OS X and
            FreeBSD; support for other platforms has not been implemented yet.

     <span class="bold">-I</span> <span class="underline">if</span>  Mirror connection content as emulated packets to interface <span class="underline">if</span> with
            destination address given by <span class="bold">-T</span>.  This option is not available if
            SSLproxy was built without mirroring support. If <span class="bold">-T</span> is omitted,
            the packets are blindly pushed to <span class="underline">if</span>.

     <span class="bold">-j</span> <span class="underline">jaildir</span>
            Change the root directory to <span class="underline">jaildir</span> using chroot(2) after opening
            files.  Note that this has implications for <span class="bold">sni</span> <span class="underline">proxyspecs</span>.
            Depending on your operating system, you will need to copy files
            such as <span class="bold">/etc/resolv.conf</span> to <span class="underline">jaildir</span> in order for name resolution
            to work.  Using <span class="bold">sni</span> proxyspecs depends on name resolution.  Some
            operating systems require special device nodes such as <span class="bold">/dev/null</span>
            to be present within the jail.  Check your system's documentation
            for details.

     <span class="bold">-J</span>     Enable connection statistics logging.

     <span class="bold">-k</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use CA private key from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> to sign certificates forged on-
            the-fly.  If <span class="underline">pemfile</span> also contains the matching CA certificate, it
            is also loaded, otherwise it must be provided with <span class="bold">-c</span>.  If <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            also contains Diffie-Hellman group parameters, they are also
            loaded, otherwise they can be provided with <span class="bold">-g</span>.  If <span class="bold">-t</span> is also
            given, SSLproxy will only forge a certificate if there is no
            matching certificate in the provided certificate directory.

     <span class="bold">-K</span> <span class="underline">pemfile</span>
            Use private key from <span class="underline">pemfile</span> for the leaf certificates forged on-
            the-fly.  If <span class="bold">-K</span> is not given, SSLproxy will generate a random
            2048-bit RSA key.

     <span class="bold">-l</span> <span class="underline">logfile</span>
            Log connections to <span class="underline">logfile</span> in a single line per connection format,
            including addresses and ports and some HTTP and SSL information,
            if available.  SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause <span class="underline">logfile</span> to be re-
            opened.

     <span class="bold">-L</span> <span class="underline">logfile</span>
            Log connection content to <span class="underline">logfile</span>.  The content log will contain a
            parsable log format with transmitted data, prepended with headers
            identifying the connection and the data length of each logged
            segment.  SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause <span class="underline">logfile</span> to be re-opened.
            Only one of <span class="bold">-F</span>, <span class="bold">-L</span> and <span class="bold">-S</span> may be used (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-m</span>     When dropping privileges using <span class="bold">-u</span>, override the target primary
            group to be set to <span class="underline">group</span>.

     <span class="bold">-M</span> <span class="underline">logfile</span>
            Log master keys to <span class="underline">logfile</span> in SSLKEYLOGFILE format as defined by
            Mozilla.  Logging master keys in this format allows for decryption
            of SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark.  Note that unlike browsers
            implementing this feature, setting the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment
            variable has no effect on SSLproxy.  SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause
            <span class="underline">logfile</span> to be re-opened.

     <span class="bold">-O</span>     Deny all Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests on all
            <span class="underline">proxyspecs</span> and for all OCSP servers with an OCSP response of
            <span class="bold">tryLater</span>, causing OCSP clients to temporarily accept even revoked
            certificates.  HTTP requests are being treated as OCSP requests if
            the method is <span class="bold">GET</span> and the URI contains a syntactically valid
            OCSPRequest ASN.1 structure parsable by OpenSSL, or if the method
            is <span class="bold">POST</span> and the <span class="bold">Content-Type</span> is <span class="bold">application/ocsp-request</span>.  For
            this to be effective, SSLproxy must be handling traffic destined
            to the port used by the OCSP server.  In particular, SSLproxy must
            be configured to receive traffic to all ports used by OCSP servers
            of targeted certificates within the <span class="underline">certdir</span> specified by <span class="bold">-t</span>.

     <span class="bold">-p</span> <span class="underline">pidfile</span>
            Write the process ID to <span class="underline">pidfile</span> and refuse to run if the <span class="underline">pidfile</span>
            is already in use by another process.

     <span class="bold">-P</span>     Passthrough SSL/TLS connections which cannot be split instead of
            dropping them.  Connections cannot be split if <span class="bold">-c</span> and <span class="bold">-k</span> are not
            given and the site does not match any certificate loaded using <span class="bold">-t</span>,
            or if the connection to the original server gives SSL/TLS errors.
            Specifically, this happens if the site requests a client
            certificate.  In these situations, passthrough with <span class="bold">-P</span> results in
            uninterrupted service for the clients, while dropping is the more
            secure alternative if unmonitored connections must be prevented.
            Passthrough mode currently does not apply to SSL/TLS errors in the
            connection from the client, since the connection from the client
            cannot easily be retried.  Specifically, <span class="bold">-P</span> does not currently
            work for clients that do not accept forged certificates.

     <span class="bold">-Q</span>     Quit after loading and testing configuration.

     <span class="bold">-q</span> <span class="underline">crlurl</span>
            Set CRL distribution point (CDP) <span class="underline">crlurl</span> on forged leaf
            certificates.  Some clients, such as some .NET applications,
            reject certificates that do not carry a CDP.  When using <span class="bold">-q</span>, you
            will need to generate an empty CRL signed by the CA certificate
            and key provided with <span class="bold">-c</span> and <span class="bold">-k</span>, and make it available at <span class="underline">crlurl</span>.

     <span class="bold">-r</span> <span class="underline">proto</span>
            Force SSL/TLS protocol version on both client and server side to
            <span class="underline">proto</span> by selecting the respective OpenSSL method constructor
            instead of the default SSLv23_method() which supports all protocol
            versions.  This is useful when analyzing traffic to a server that
            only supports a specific version of SSL/TLS and does not implement
            proper protocol negotiation.  Depending on build options and the
            version of OpenSSL that is used, the following values for <span class="underline">proto</span>
            are accepted: <span class="bold">ssl2</span>, <span class="bold">ssl3</span>, <span class="bold">tls10</span>, <span class="bold">tls11</span>, <span class="bold">tls12</span>, and <span class="bold">tls13</span>.  Note
            that SSL 2.0 support is not built in by default because some
            servers don't handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages gracefully.

     <span class="bold">-R</span> <span class="underline">proto</span>
            Disable the SSL/TLS protocol version <span class="underline">proto</span> on both client and
            server side by disabling the respective protocols in OpenSSL.  To
            disable multiple protocol versions, <span class="bold">-R</span> can be given multiple
            times.  If <span class="underline">-r</span> is also given, there will be no effect in disabling
            other protocol versions.  Disabling protocol versions is useful
            when analyzing traffic to a server that does not handle some
            protocol versions well, or to test behaviour with different
            protocol versions.  Depending on build options and the version of
            OpenSSL that is used, the following values for <span class="underline">proto</span> are accepted:
            <span class="bold">ssl2</span>, <span class="bold">ssl3</span>, <span class="bold">tls10</span>, <span class="bold">tls11</span>, <span class="bold">tls12</span>, and <span class="bold">tls13</span>.  Note that SSL 2.0
            support is not built in by default because some servers don't
            handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages gracefully.

     <span class="bold">-s</span> <span class="underline">ciphers</span>
            Use OpenSSL <span class="underline">ciphers</span> specification for both server and client
            SSL/TLS connections.  If <span class="bold">-s</span> is not given, a cipher list of
            <span class="bold">ALL:-aNULL</span> is used.  Normally, SSL/TLS implementations choose the
            most secure cipher suites, not the fastest ones.  By specifying an
            appropriate OpenSSL cipher list, the set of cipher suites can be
            limited to fast algorithms, or <span class="bold">eNULL</span> cipher suites can be added.
            Note that for connections to be successful, the SSLproxy cipher
            suites must include at least one cipher suite supported by both
            the client and the server of each connection.  See ciphers(1) for
            details on how to construct OpenSSL cipher lists.

     <span class="bold">-S</span> <span class="underline">logdir</span>
            Log connection content to separate log files under <span class="underline">logdir</span>.  For
            each connection, a log file will be written, which will contain
            both directions of data as transmitted.  Information about the
            connection will be contained in the filename only.  Only one of
            <span class="bold">-F</span>, <span class="bold">-L</span> and <span class="bold">-S</span> may be used (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-t</span> <span class="underline">certdir</span>
            Use private key, certificate and certificate chain from PEM files
            in <span class="underline">certdir</span> for connections to hostnames matching the respective
            certificates, instead of using certificates forged on-the-fly.  A
            single PEM file must contain a single private key, a single
            certificate and optionally intermediate and root CA certificates
            to use as certificate chain.  When using <span class="bold">-t</span>, SSLproxy will first
            attempt to use a matching certificate loaded from <span class="underline">certdir</span>.  If <span class="bold">-c</span>
            and <span class="bold">-k</span> are also given, certificates will be forged on-the-fly for
            sites matching none of the common names in the certificates loaded
            from <span class="underline">certdir</span>.  Otherwise, connections matching no certificate will
            be dropped, or if <span class="bold">-P</span> is given, passed through without splitting
            SSL/TLS.

     <span class="bold">-T</span> <span class="underline">addr</span>
            Mirror connection content as emulated packets to destination
            address <span class="underline">addr</span> on the interface given by <span class="bold">-I</span>.  Only IPv4 target
            addresses are currently supported. Also, only targets with
            ethernet address assigned can be used with this option; for
            example, the loopback address 127.0.0.1 cannot be used as target
            address. Not used if the target is irrelevant (e.g. mirror to
            dummy device). This option is not available if SSLproxy was built
            without mirroring support.

     <span class="bold">-u</span> <span class="underline">user</span>
            Drop privileges after opening sockets and files by setting the
            real, effective and stored user IDs to <span class="underline">user</span> and loading the
            appropriate primary and ancillary groups.  If <span class="bold">-u</span> is not given,
            SSLproxy will drop privileges to the stored UID if EUID != UID
            (setuid bit scenario), or to <span class="bold">nobody</span> if running with full <span class="bold">root</span>
            privileges (EUID == UID == 0).  User <span class="underline">user</span> needs to be allowed to
            make outbound TCP connections, and in some configurations, to also
            perform DNS resolution.  Dropping privileges enables privilege
            separation, which incurs latency for certain options, such as
            separate per-connection log files.  By using <span class="bold">-u</span> <span class="bold">root</span>, SSLproxy can
            be run as root without dropping privileges.  Due to an Apple bug,
            <span class="bold">-u</span> cannot be used with <span class="bold">pf</span> proxyspecs on Mac OS X.

     <span class="bold">-x</span> <span class="underline">engine</span>
            Use the OpenSSL engine with identifier <span class="underline">engine</span> as a default engine.
            The engine must be available within the OpenSSL ecosystem under
            the specified identifier, that is, they must be loaded from the
            global OpenSSL configuration.  If <span class="underline">engine</span> is an absolute path, it
            will be interpreted as path to an engine dynamically linked
            library and loaded by path, regardless of global OpenSSL
            configuration.  This option is only available if built against a
            version of OpenSSL with engine support.

     <span class="bold">-X</span> <span class="underline">pcapfile</span>
            Log connection content to <span class="underline">pcapfile</span> in PCAP format, with emulated
            TCP, IP and Ethernet headers.  SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause
            <span class="underline">pcapfile</span> to be re-opened.  Only one of <span class="bold">-X</span>, <span class="bold">-Y</span> and <span class="bold">-y</span> may be used
            (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-Y</span> <span class="underline">pcapdir</span>
            Log connection content to separate PCAP files under <span class="underline">pcapdir</span>.  For
            each connection, a separate PCAP file will be written.  Only one
            of <span class="bold">-X</span>, <span class="bold">-Y</span> and <span class="bold">-y</span> may be used (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-y</span> <span class="underline">pcapspec</span>
            Log connection content to separate PCAP files with the given path
            specification (see LOG SPECIFICATIONS below).  For each
            connection, a separate PCAP file will be written.  Only one of <span class="bold">-X</span>,
            <span class="bold">-Y</span> and <span class="bold">-y</span> may be used (last one wins).

     <span class="bold">-n</span>     Enable split mode of operation for all proxyspecs, effectively
            making sslproxy behave like sslsplit.

     <span class="bold">-V</span>     Display version and compiled features information and exit.

     <span class="bold">-w</span> <span class="underline">gendir</span>
            Write generated keys and certificates to individual files in
            <span class="underline">gendir</span>.  For keys, the key identifier is used as filename, which
            consists of the SHA-1 hash of the ASN.1 bit string of the public
            key, as referenced by the subjectKeyIdentifier extension in
            certificates.  For certificates, the SHA-1 fingerprints of the
            original and the used (forged) certificate are combined to form
            the filename.  Note that only newly generated certificates are
            written to disk.

     <span class="bold">-W</span> <span class="underline">gendir</span>
            Same as <span class="bold">-w</span>, but also write original certificates and certificates
            not newly generated, such as those loaded from <span class="bold">-t</span>.

     <span class="bold">-Z</span>     Disable SSL/TLS compression on all connections.  This is useful if
            your limiting factor is CPU, not network bandwidth.  The <span class="bold">-Z</span> option
            is only available if SSLproxy was built against a version of
            OpenSSL which supports disabling compression.

<span class="bold">PROXY</span> <span class="bold">SPECIFICATIONS</span>
     SSLproxy supports two types of proxy specifications: one line and
     structured.  The structured proxy specifications provide more
     configuration options, but can only be defined in configuration files.
     See sslproxy.conf(5) and the sample configuration file in the sources for
     details.

     One line proxy specifications (<span class="underline">proxyspecs</span>) consist of the connection
     type, listen address and program port. You can also specify program and
     return addresses, otherwise they default to the loopback address
     127.0.0.1. The program and return address options help you divert packets
     to remote locations. However, beware that the diverted traffic is always
     unencrypted:

     <span class="bold">https</span> <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>
     <span class="bold">https</span> <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span> <span class="underline">ua:addr</span> <span class="underline">ra:addr</span>

     <span class="bold">ssl</span>   <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>
     <span class="bold">http</span>  <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>
     <span class="bold">pop3</span>  <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>
     <span class="bold">smtp</span>  <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>
     <span class="bold">tcp</span>   <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span> <span class="underline">up:port</span>

     <span class="bold">https</span>  SSL/TLS interception with HTTP protocol decoding, including the
            removal of HPKP, HSTS, Upgrade and Alternate Protocol response
            headers.  This mode currently suppresses WebSockets and HTTP/2.

     <span class="bold">pop3s</span>  SSL/TLS interception with POP3 protocol decoding.

     <span class="bold">smtps</span>  SSL/TLS interception with SMTP protocol decoding.

     <span class="bold">ssl</span>    SSL/TLS interception without any lower level protocol decoding;
            decrypted connection content is treated as opaque stream of bytes
            and not modified.

     <span class="bold">http</span>   Plain TCP connection without SSL/TLS, with HTTP protocol decoding,
            including the removal of HPKP, HSTS, Upgrade and Alternate
            Protocol response headers.  This mode currently suppresses
            WebSockets and HTTP/2.

     <span class="bold">pop3</span>   Plain POP3 connection without SSL/TLS and with POP3 protocol
            decoding.

     <span class="bold">smtp</span>   Plain SMTP connection without SSL/TLS and with SMTP protocol
            decoding.

     <span class="bold">tcp</span>    Plain TCP connection without SSL/TLS and without any lower level
            protocol decoding; decrypted connection content is treated as
            opaque stream of bytes and not modified.

     <span class="bold">autossl</span>
            Plain TCP connection until a Client Hello SSL/TLS message appears
            in the byte stream, then automatic upgrade to SSL/TLS
            interception.  This is generic, protocol-independent STARTTLS
            support, that may erroneously trigger on byte sequences that look
            like Client Hello messages even though there was no actual
            STARTTLS command issued.

     <span class="underline">listenaddr</span> <span class="underline">port</span>
            IPv4 or IPv6 address and port or service name to listen on.  This
            is the address and port where the NAT engine should redirect
            connections to.

     <span class="underline">up:port</span>
            Port or service name that the program is listening for
            connections.  This is the port where the traffic should be
            diverted to.

     <span class="underline">ua:addr</span>
            Address that the program is listening for connections.  This is
            the address where the traffic should be diverted to.  If not
            specified, defaults to 127.0.0.1.

     <span class="underline">ra:addr</span>
            Address that the program should return packets to.  This is the
            address where SSLproxy is listening for returned packets from the
            program.  This address is inserted into the SSLproxy header line
            along with the dynamically assigned port number.  If not
            specified, defaults to 127.0.0.1.

<span class="bold">LOG</span> <span class="bold">SPECIFICATIONS</span>
     Log specifications are composed of zero or more printf-style directives;
     ordinary characters are included directly in the output path.  SSLproxy
     current supports the following directives:

     <span class="underline">%T</span>     The initial connection time as an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.

     <span class="underline">%d</span>     The destination host and port, separated by a comma, IPv6
            addresses using underscore instead of colon.

     <span class="underline">%D</span>     The destination host, IPv6 addresses using underscore instead of
            colon.

     <span class="underline">%p</span>     The destination port.

     <span class="underline">%s</span>     The source host and port, separated by a comma, IPv6 addresses
            using underscore instead of colon.

     <span class="underline">%S</span>     The source host, IPv6 addresses using underscore instead of colon.

     <span class="underline">%q</span>     The source port.

     <span class="underline">%x</span>     The name of the local process.  Requires <span class="bold">-i</span> to be used.  If
            process information is unavailable, this directive will be omitted
            from the output path.

     <span class="underline">%X</span>     The full path of the local process.  Requires <span class="bold">-i</span> to be used.  If
            process information is unavailable, this directive will be omitted
            from the output path.

     <span class="underline">%u</span>     The username or numeric uid of the local process.  Requires <span class="bold">-i</span> to
            be used.  If process information is unavailable, this directive
            will be omitted from the output path.

     <span class="underline">%g</span>     The group name or numeric gid of the local process.  Requires <span class="bold">-i</span>
            to be used.  If process information is unavailable, this directive
            will be omitted from the output path.

     <span class="underline">%%</span>     A literal '%' character.

<span class="bold">NAT</span> <span class="bold">ENGINES</span>
     SSLproxy currently supports the following NAT engines:

     <span class="bold">pf</span>     OpenBSD packet filter (pf) <span class="bold">rdr</span>/<span class="bold">rdr-to</span> NAT redirects, also
            available on FreeBSD, NetBSD and Mac OS X.  Fully supported,
            including IPv6.  Note that SSLproxy needs permission to open
            <span class="bold">/dev/pf</span> for reading, which by default means that it needs to run
            under <span class="bold">root</span> privileges.  Assuming inbound interface <span class="bold">em0</span>, first in
            old (FreeBSD, Mac OS X), then in new (OpenBSD 4.7+) syntax:

     <span class="bold">ipfilter</span>
            IPFilter (ipfilter, ipf), available on many systems, including
            FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux and Solaris.  Note that SSLproxy needs
            permission to open <span class="bold">/dev/ipnat</span> for reading, which by default means
            that it needs to run under <span class="bold">root</span> privileges.  Only supports IPv4
            due to limitations in the SIOCGNATL ioctl(2) interface.  Assuming
            inbound interface <span class="bold">bge0</span>:

     <span class="bold">netfilter</span>
            Linux netfilter using the iptables REDIRECT target.  Fully
            supported including IPv6 since Linux v3.8-rc1; on older kernels
            only supports IPv4 due to limitations in the SO_ORIGINAL_DST

            Note that SSLproxy is only able to accept incoming connections if
            it binds to the correct IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.1) or on all
            interfaces (0.0.0.0).  REDIRECT uses the local interface address
            of the incoming interface as target IP address, or 127.0.0.1 for
            locally generated packets.

     <span class="bold">tproxy</span> Linux netfilter using the iptables TPROXY target together with
            routing table magic to allow non-local traffic to originate on

            Note that return path filtering (rp_filter) also needs to be
            disabled on interfaces which handle TPROXY redirected traffic.

<span class="bold">SIGNALS</span>
     A running <span class="bold">sslproxy</span> accepts SIGINT and SIGTERM for a clean shutdown and
     SIGUSR1 to re-open the single-file log files (such as <span class="bold">-l</span>, <span class="bold">-L</span> and <span class="bold">-X</span>).
     The canonical way to rotate or post-process logs is to rename the active
     log file, send SIGUSR1 to the PID in the PID file given by <span class="bold">-p</span>, give
     SSLproxy some time to flush buffers after closing the old file, and then
     post-process the renamed log file.  Per-connection log files (such as <span class="bold">-S</span>
     and <span class="bold">-F</span>) are not re-opened because their filename is specific to the
     connection.

<span class="bold">EXIT</span> <span class="bold">STATUS</span>
     The <span class="bold">sslproxy</span> process will exit with 0 on regular shutdown (SIGINT,
     SIGTERM), and 128 + signal number on controlled shutdown based on
     receiving a different signal such as SIGHUP.  Exit status in the range
     1..127 indicates error conditions.

<span class="bold">EXAMPLES</span>
     With configuration similar to the above NAT engine samples, intercept

<span class="bold">NOTES</span>
     SSLproxy is able to handle a relatively high number of listeners and
     connections due to a multithreaded, event based architecture based on
     libevent, taking advantage of platform specific select() replacements
     such as kqueue.  The main thread handles the listeners and signaling,
     while a number of worker threads equal to twice the number of CPU cores
     is used for handling the actual connections in separate event bases,
     including the CPU-intensive SSL/TLS handling.

     Care has been taken to choose well-performing data structures for caching
     certificates and SSL sessions.  Logging is implemented in separate disk
     writer threads to ensure that socket event handling threads don't have to
     block on disk I/O.  DNS lookups are performed asynchronously.  SSLproxy
     uses SSL session caching on both ends to minimize the amount of full SSL
     handshakes, but even then, the limiting factor in handling SSL
     connections are the actual bignum computations.

     For high performance and low latency and when running SSLproxy as root or
     otherwise in a privilege separation mode, avoid using options which
     require a privileged operation to be invoked through privilege separation
     for each connection.  These are currently all per-connection log types:
     content log to per-stream file in dir or filespec (<span class="bold">-F</span>, <span class="bold">-S</span>), content log
     to per-stream PCAP in dir or filespec (<span class="bold">-Y</span>, <span class="bold">-y</span>), and generated or all
     certificates to files in directory (<span class="bold">-w</span>, <span class="bold">-W</span>).  Instead, use the respective
     single-file variants where available.  It is possible, albeit not
     recommended, to bypass the default privilege separation when run as root
     by using <span class="bold">-u</span> <span class="bold">root</span>, thereby bypassing privilege separation entirely.
